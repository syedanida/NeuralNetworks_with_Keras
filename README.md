## 📚 Part 1: Data Augmentation & Generalization Techniques

In this part, we explore various augmentation strategies and generalization techniques using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **KerasCV**, **AugLy**, **NLPAug**, and **fastai**.

### ✅ Regularization Techniques (A/B tested)
- `l1`, `l2`, and combined regularization
- Dropout layers
- Early stopping and custom callbacks
- Monte Carlo Dropout (for uncertainty estimation)
- Various initializations (He, Glorot, etc.)
- Batch Normalization and custom dropout
- TensorBoard tracking
- Hyperparameter tuning using **Keras Tuner**

### ✅ Data Augmentation Domains
Each subdomain includes implementation using either TensorFlow, AugLy, or specialized libraries:
